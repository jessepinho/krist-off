# Krist-off

A Chrome extension to help New York Times readers avoid the written works of [Nicholas D. Kri&mdash;sorry, Nicholas Kristof](http://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/01/whats-missing-in-my-byline/).

## Planned features

- Show prettier warnings when you've (mistakenly, of course) browsed to a Kristof article.
- Customize which authors you wish to avoid.
